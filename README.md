## What is this?

Most code reviews are generalist — one person (or one AI) trying to catch everything. They miss things. A design engineer would have caught the dark mode gap. A performance engineer would have flagged the unbounded memory growth. An accessibility engineer would have noticed the keyboard trap.

**Orbit Audit Suite gives you all of them.** Each lens is a specialist that knows exactly what to look for in its domain, complete with project-specific gotchas and checklists. Run one lens or all ten — your call.

## Install

```bash
/plugin install Recusive/Orbit-plugin
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Audit a plan before implementation
/full-audit docs/plans/my-feature-plan.md

# Audit your uncommitted changes
/full-audit

# Run a single lens
/audit-as-frontend-eng docs/plans/my-feature-plan.md
/audit-as-a11y-eng docs/plans/my-feature-plan.md
```

## The 10 Lenses

| # | Skill | Expert | What They Catch |
|---|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | `audit-as-design-eng` | Design Engineer | Visual hierarchy, design token fidelity, dark mode parity, interactive states, animation quality |
| 2 | `audit-as-ux-eng` | UX Engineer | User journey gaps, broken mental models, missing feedback, discoverability, error recovery |
| 3 | `audit-as-frontend-eng` | Frontend Engineer | React anti-patterns, Zustand pitfalls, type safety gaps, unnecessary re-renders, bundle bloat |
| 4 | `audit-as-backend-eng` | Backend Engineer | Rust error handling, concurrency hazards, resource leaks, IPC mismatches, file system safety |
| 5 | `audit-as-structural-eng` | Structural Architect | Module coupling, dependency direction, layer violations, abstraction mismatches, circular deps |
| 6 | `audit-as-repo-maintainer` | Repo Maintainer | Convention drift, missing barrel exports, naming inconsistency, dead code, import hygiene |
| 7 | `audit-as-prod-readiness` | Production Engineer | Dev/prod parity, missing error recovery, data integrity, rollback safety, deployment gaps |
| 8 | `audit-as-dx-eng` | DX Engineer | Error message quality, CLI ergonomics, keyboard-first design, config defaults, developer flow |
| 9 | `audit-as-perf-eng` | Performance Engineer | Memory accumulation, IPC latency, streaming bottlenecks, startup impact, long-session stability |
| 10 | `audit-as-a11y-eng` | Accessibility Engineer | Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA compliance, contrast |

Each lens includes a **Gotchas** section — the most common failures Claude makes from that perspective — and a **Signature Section** that only that expert produces (e.g., Visual State Coverage matrix, Keyboard Navigation Walkthrough, Resource Budget table).

## The Orchestrator

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `full-audit` | Runs all relevant lenses sequentially into **one document** with master verdict, cross-cutting concerns, and deduplicated findings |

### Two Modes

**Plan Mode** — audit before you build:
```
/full-audit docs/plans/my-plan.md
```

**Repo Mode** — audit what you've built:
```
/full-audit
```
Choose from:
1. **Uncommitted changes** — working tree diff
2. **Branch vs main** — PR-level review
3. **General repo health** — broad codebase check

### Smart Lens Selection

Not every lens applies to every plan. The orchestrator reads your plan/changes and skips irrelevant lenses automatically:
- Backend-only change? Skips Design, UX, A11y
- Frontend-only? Skips Backend
- Repo Maintainer and Production Readiness always run

### Output

Everything consolidates into one file: `reviews/audit-plan-full.md`

```
Master Verdict + Cross-Cutting Concerns + All Critical Issues
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## 1. Design Engineer         ← full analysis
## 2. UX Engineer             ← full analysis
## 3. Frontend Engineer       ← full analysis
...
## 10. Accessibility Engineer ← full analysis
```

The **Cross-Cutting Concerns** section is where the real value lives — issues flagged by multiple independent lenses are systemic problems, not isolated nitpicks.

## Cross-References

Six lenses reference existing Claude Code skills for deeper guidance when issues are found:

| Lens | References |
|------|-----------|
| Design | `emil-design-engineering`, `make-interfaces-feel-better`, `web-animation-design` |
| UX | `web-design-guidelines`, `emil-design-engineering` |
| Frontend | `vercel-react-best-practices` |
| Structural | `vercel-react-best-practices` |
| Performance | `vercel-react-best-practices`, `web-animation-design` |
| Accessibility | `emil-design-engineering`, `web-design-guidelines`, `web-animation-design` |

These are optional — every lens works standalone, but produces richer recommendations when the referenced skills are also installed.

## How It Fits Your Pipeline

```
problem-clarifier → write plan → fazxes (scope) → full-audit → implement
```

Or use individual lenses for focused reviews at any stage.
